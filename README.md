# Pico-LCd-114
CircuitPython demo for Waveshare Pico LCD 1.14" Screen ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0948T7M9S?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1))

This was made to show the Waveshare Pico LCD 1.14" Screen using CircuitPython versus the MicroPython example provided.  This was based on the version 8 of CircuitPython, and uses:
* adafruit_st7789
* adafruit_display_text
* adafruit_display_shapes

Once you have version 8 of CircuitPython loaded, you can download the additional modules from: [Circuit Python](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).  Direct link [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/download/20221214/adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-8.x-mpy-20221214.zip).  Unzip the file, and copy the libraries in the above list.

Hope this helps!
